                                    You can use Pulse absolutely free for 30 days. After 30 days,
                                    we will charge the credit card you used when you  sign up. If
                                    you choose to cancel your account before your trial ends, your

                                    Financial Accounts are a grouping of income and expense
                                    items that can be used for tracking or reporting purposes.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    They're designed to be flexible and can be used to
                                    differentiate between bank accounts, companies, individuals
                                    or between personal and business entries.

                                    No. There is no contract when you use Pulse, other than
                                    agreeing to our Terms of Service.

                                    Yes - you can cancel your account at any time. To cancel your
                                    account, go to your billing page and click on “Please cancel my
                                    account” at the bottom of the page. The account owner is the
                                    only one who can cancel an account. An email request to
                                    delete an account is not considered cancellation.
